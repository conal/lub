== Abstract ==

Lub is an experiment in computing least upper information bounds on (partially defined) functional values.
It provides a <hask>lub</hask> function that is consistent with the <hask>unamb</hask> operator but has a more liberal precondition.
Where <hask>unamb</hask> requires its arguments to equal when neither is bottom, <hask>lub</hask> is able to synthesize a value from the partial information contained in both of its arguments.
